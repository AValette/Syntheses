	The main objective of lift is to counrbalance the weight: 
	
	\begin{equation}
	W = L = C_L \frac{1}{2} \rho _\infty V_\infty ^2 S.
	\end{equation}
	
	Suppose now that $V_\infty \ll$, there are 2 options to increase lift: increasing $C_L$ or increasing $S$. The problem is that the 2 solutions increase the drag, the first need an increased camber, and for the second $D = C_D \frac{1}{2} \rho _\infty V_\infty ^2 S$.
