\section{High lift devices}	
	The main objective of lift is to counterbalance the weight: 
	
	\begin{equation}
	W = L = C_L \frac{1}{2} \rho _\infty V_\infty ^2 S.
	\end{equation}
	
	Suppose now that $V_\infty \ll$, there are 2 options to increase lift: increasing $C_L$ or increasing $S$. The problem is that the 2 solutions increase the drag, the first need an increased camber, and for the second $D = C_D \frac{1}{2} \rho _\infty V_\infty ^2 S$. The best solution is to increase $C_L$ only for $V_\infty \ll$ and this can be done by changing the geometry or by controlling the boundary layer (attached flow). 
	
\subsection{Trailing edge flaps}
\subsubsection{Plain flap}
	\wrapfig{4}{r}{5}{0.2}{ch5/1}{ch5/1}
	The principle of flaps is to increase the camber. This is the most simple, the trailing edge shifts downward, increasing $C_L$. The characteristics are: 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item[•] Because of separation appearing earlier $\alpha _{stall} \searrow$, this is better for the view of the pilot. 
	\item[•] $C_L(max)$ is up to 50\% higher, reached for high deflection $\approx 80\degres$.
	\item[•] The drag increases much more than the lift $C_L/C_D \searrow$, this is good for landing as it helps to decelerate.
	\item[•] Center of pressure at the trailing edge $\rightarrow \Delta C_m<0$ (nose down). 
	\end{itemize}
	
\subsubsection{Split flap}
	\wrapfig{3}{r}{3}{0.25}{ch5/2}{ch5/2} \ \\
	\begin{itemize}
	\item[•] Separation appears later than the previous case, $\alpha _{stall} \searrow$ less. 
	\item[•] Larger wake because of the split $\rightarrow$ more drag, not good for take off. 
	\item[•] $C_L(max) \nearrow$ up to 60\% and nose down less than previous case. 
	\end{itemize}
	
\subsubsection{Slotted flap}
	\wrapfig{5}{l}{4}{0.25}{ch5/3}{ch5/3}
	In this case $\alpha _{stall}$ increases compared to plain because of the slot allowing the control of separation and the increase of $C_D$ is smaller than the plain flap. $C_L(max) \approx 65\%$.
	
	\ \\
	
\subsubsection{Fowler flap}
	\wrapfig{6}{r}{4}{0.25}{ch5/4}{ch5/4}
	This the most used type of flap, combination of the slotted flap and a backward motion: 
	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item[•] $C_L \nearrow$ further compared to slotted.  
	\item[•] $\alpha _{stall} \searrow$ compared to slotted because of $\frac{t}
{c}\searrow$.
	\item[•] $\Delta C_D \searrow$ because boundary layer control + $\frac{t}{c} \searrow$.
	\item[•] $\Delta C_m \gg$ because flap going backward. In practice, the fowler flap contains many slots. 
	\end{itemize}
	
	The figures below shows a good summary.

\paragraph{Remarks}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item[•] $\frac{dC_m}{dC_L}\approx cst$, this implies that k in $C_m = C_{m0} + k C_L$ does not change and that the \textbf{aerodynamic center} doesn't change. 
	
	\item[•] The flaps are placed near the fuselage, this decreases the efficiency, changes the loft distribution on the wing that have effect on $D_i$ and the pressure center closer to the fuselage can have effects on the stability. 
	
	\item[•] Other types of flaps: Zap flap (split + fowler), $C_L$ is higher than the split but the drag is higher than fowler. 
	\end{itemize}		
	
\subsection{Slat}
	\minifig{ch5/8}{ch5/9}{0.3}{0.3}{0.3}{0.3}
	The slats are separated from the airfoil by a slot. This allows to energies the boundary layer by a flow through the slot. This has no effect for small $/alpha$, it allows to increase $\alpha _{stall}$ going from 15\degres to 25\degres, increasing $C_L(max)$ up to 60\%. The disadvantage is that for low speeds the drag decreases (less detached boundary), this is bad for landing. And for higher speeds the flow disturbance increases the drag. \textbf{Controllable slats} are necessary. \\
	
	The second disadvantage is that to have the lift increase effect we nee to go to very high $\alpha$, not good for the sight of the pilot. 
	
\subsection{Leading edge flap}
	\minifig{ch5/10}{ch5/11}{0.3}{0.3}{0.3}{0.3}
	Deflection at high $\alpha$ can prevent LE separation, and this even more for high velocity wings with sharp LE. The lift coefficient increases because of increased camber, but the $\alpha _{stall}$ is less than the slat. \\

	Indeed all of these are used together nowadays.
